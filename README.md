## Overview
This project is a simple To-Do List App made using Django. The webpages were designed using Bootstrap CSS.
Users can register for an account and log in. Passwords are encrypted in the database.
Users can then add tasks to task lists. When they mark the task as done, it is crossed out in the task list.
By default, tasks are added to the default task list.
